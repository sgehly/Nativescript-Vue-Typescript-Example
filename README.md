# Nativescript + Vue + Typescript + Webpack 4

> A tale of tears, dependency issues, ugly code, and custom modules

The base of this repo was provided by https://github.com/nativescript-vue/vue-cli-template.

This is a *very* bare and ugly repository with a somewhat-working example of Nativescript running VueJS implementing Typescript building with Webpack 4.

In package.json you'll notice 

https://github.com/sgehly/ns-vue-loader (simple options upgrade for the new webpack)

and

https://github.com/sgehly/nativescript-vue-target (Oh god I just ignored chunks)

These are both just as broken as you might assume, I'm pretty sure I just comment out large sections of code in the second one to get it to work. But hey, this isn't for work and isn't for a client so I can't spend that much time on it.

But hey, it runs and runs the example provided by vue-cli-template so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I'll continue working on this in my spare time until more experienced people decide to take over.
